1,CenterSnap SingleShot MultiObject 3D Shape Reconstruction and Categorical 6D Pose and Size Estimation,Muhammad Zubair Irshad Thomas Kollar Michael Laskey Kevin Stone Zsolt Kira,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO),"  This paper studies the complex task of simultaneous multi-object 3Dreconstruction, 6D pose and size estimation from a single-view RGB-Dobservation. In contrast to instance-level pose estimation, we focus on a morechallenging problem where CAD models are not available at inference time.Existing approaches mainly follow a complex multi-stage pipeline which firstlocalizes and detects each object instance in the image and then regresses toeither their 3D meshes or 6D poses. These approaches suffer fromhigh-computational cost and low performance in complex multi-object scenarios,where occlusions can be present. Hence, we present a simple one-stage approachto predict both the 3D shape and estimate the 6D pose and size jointly in abounding-box free manner. In particular, our method treats object instances asspatial centers where each center denotes the complete shape of an object alongwith its 6D pose and size. Through this per-pixel representation, our approachcan reconstruct in real-time (40 FPS) multiple novel object instances andpredict their 6D pose and sizes in a single-forward pass. Through extensiveexperiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms allshape completion and categorical 6D pose and size estimation baselines onmulti-object ShapeNet and NOCS datasets respectively with a 12.6% absoluteimprovement in mAP for 6D pose for novel real-world object instances.

2,Recovering 3D Human Mesh from Monocular Images A Survey,Yating Tian Hongwen Zhang Yebin Liu Limin Wang,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Graphics (cs.GR),"  Estimating human pose and shape from monocular images is a long-standingproblem in computer vision. Since the release of statistical body models, 3Dhuman mesh recovery has been drawing broader attention. With the same goal ofobtaining well-aligned and physically plausible mesh results, two paradigmshave been developed to overcome challenges in the 2D-to-3D lifting process: i)an optimization-based paradigm, where different data terms and regularizationterms are exploited as optimization objectives; and ii) a regression-basedparadigm, where deep learning techniques are embraced to solve the problem inan end-to-end fashion. Meanwhile, continuous efforts are devoted to improvingthe quality of 3D mesh labels for a wide range of datasets. Though remarkableprogress has been achieved in the past decade, the task is still challengingdue to flexible body motions, diverse appearances, complex environments, andinsufficient in-the-wild annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst survey to focus on the task of monocular 3D human mesh recovery. We startwith the introduction of body models, and then introduce recovery frameworksand training objectives by providing in-depth analyses of their strengths andweaknesses. We also summarize datasets, evaluation metrics, and benchmarkresults. Open issues and future directions are discussed in the end, hoping tomotivate researchers and facilitate their research in this area.

This survey is inspired by theremarkable progress in both computer vision and natural language processing,and recent trends shifting from single modality processing to multiple modalitycomprehension. We summarize the development in this field into three timeperiods, namely task-specific methods, vision-language pre-training (VLP)methods, and larger models empowered by large-scale weakly-labeled data. Wefirst take some common VL tasks as examples to introduce the development oftask-specific methods. Then we focus on VLP methods and comprehensively reviewkey components of the model structures and training methods. After that, weshow how recent work utilizes large-scale raw image-text data to learnlanguage-aligned visual representations that generalize better on zero or fewshot learning tasks. Finally, we discuss some potential future trends towardsmodality cooperation, unified representation, and knowledge incorporation. Webelieve that this review will be of help for researchers and practitioners ofAI and ML, especially those interested in computer vision and natural languageprocessing.

4,Playable Environments Video Manipulation in Space and Time,Willi Menapace Aliaksandr Siarohin Christian Theobalt Vladislav Golyanik Sergey Tulyakov Stéphane Lathuilière Elisa Ricci,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  We present Playable Environments - a new representation for interactive videogeneration and manipulation in space and time. With a single image at inferencetime, our novel framework allows the user to move objects in 3D whilegenerating a video by providing a sequence of desired actions. The actions arelearnt in an unsupervised manner. The camera can be controlled to get thedesired viewpoint. Our method builds an environment state for each frame, whichcan be manipulated by our proposed action module and decoded back to the imagespace with volumetric rendering. To support diverse appearances of objects, weextend neural radiance fields with style-based modulation. Our method trains ona collection of various monocular videos requiring only the estimated cameraparameters and 2D object locations. To set a challenging benchmark, weintroduce two large scale video datasets with significant camera movements. Asevidenced by our experiments, playable environments enable several creativeapplications not attainable by prior video synthesis works, including playable3D video generation, stylization and manipulation.

5,Instance Segmentation for Autonomous Log Grasping in Forestry Operations,JeanMichel Fortin Olivier Gamache Vincent Grondin François Pomerleau Philippe Giguère,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Robotics (cs.RO),"  Wood logs picking is a challenging task to automate. Indeed, logs usuallycome in cluttered configurations, randomly orientated and overlapping. Recentwork on log picking automation usually assume that the logs' pose is known,with little consideration given to the actual perception problem. In thispaper, we squarely address the latter, using a data-driven approach. First, weintroduce a novel dataset, named TimberSeg 1.0, that is densely annotated,i.e., that includes both bounding boxes and pixel-level mask annotations forlogs. This dataset comprises 220 images with 2500 individually segmented logs.Using our dataset, we then compare three neural network architectures on thetask of individual logs detection and segmentation; two region-based methodsand one attention-based method. Unsurprisingly, our results show thataxis-aligned proposals, failing to take into account the directional nature oflogs, underperform with 19.03 mAP. A rotation-aware proposal methodsignificantly improve results to 31.83 mAP. More interestingly, aTransformer-based approach, without any inductive bias on rotations,outperformed the two others, achieving a mAP of 57.53 on our dataset. Our usecase demonstrates the limitations of region-based approaches for cluttered,elongated objects. It also highlights the potential of attention-based methodson this specific task, as they work directly at the pixel-level. Theseencouraging results indicate that such a perception system could be used toassist the operators on the short-term, or to fully automate log pickingoperations in the future.

6,TCTrack Temporal Contexts for Aerial Tracking,Ziang Cao Ziyuan Huang Liang Pan Shiwei Zhang Ziwei Liu Changhong Fu,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Temporal contexts among consecutive frames are far from been fully utilizedin existing visual trackers. In this work, we present TCTrack, a comprehensiveframework to fully exploit temporal contexts for aerial tracking. The temporalcontexts are incorporated at \textbf{two levels}: the extraction of\textbf{features} and the refinement of \textbf{similarity maps}. Specifically,for feature extraction, an online temporally adaptive convolution is proposedto enhance the spatial features using temporal information, which is achievedby dynamically calibrating the convolution weights according to the previousframes. For similarity map refinement, we propose an adaptive temporaltransformer, which first effectively encodes temporal knowledge in amemory-efficient way, before the temporal knowledge is decoded for accurateadjustment of the similarity map. TCTrack is effective and efficient:evaluation on four aerial tracking benchmarks shows its impressive performance;real-world UAV tests show its high speed of over 27 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson AGXXavier.

7,LatentFormer MultiAgent TransformerBased Interaction Modeling and Trajectory Prediction,Elmira Amirloo Amir Rasouli Peter Lakner Mohsen Rohani Jun Luo,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Multi-agent trajectory prediction is a fundamental problem in autonomousdriving. The key challenges in prediction are accurately anticipating thebehavior of surrounding agents and understanding the scene context. To addressthese problems, we propose LatentFormer, a transformer-based model forpredicting future vehicle trajectories. The proposed method leverages a noveltechnique for modeling interactions among dynamic objects in the scene.Contrary to many existing approaches which model cross-agent interactionsduring the observation time, our method additionally exploits the future statesof the agents. This is accomplished using a hierarchical attention mechanismwhere the evolving states of the agents autoregressively control thecontributions of past trajectories and scene encodings in the final prediction.Furthermore, we propose a multi-resolution map encoding scheme that relies on avision transformer module to effectively capture both local and global scenecontext to guide the generation of more admissible future trajectories. Weevaluate the proposed method on the nuScenes benchmark dataset and show thatour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves upon trajectorymetrics by up to 40%. We further investigate the contributions of variouscomponents of the proposed technique via extensive ablation studies.    ",2022/03/03,Computer Vision,124,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,A study on the distribution of social biases in selfsupervised learning visual models,Kirill Sirotkin Pablo Carballeira Marcos EscuderoViñolo,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Deep neural networks are efficient at learning the data distribution if it issufficiently sampled. However, they can be strongly biased by non-relevantfactors implicitly incorporated in the training data. These include operationalbiases, such as ineffective or uneven data sampling, but also ethical concerns,as the social biases are implicitly present\textemdash even inadvertently, inthe training data or explicitly defined in unfair training schedules. In taskshaving impact on human processes, the learning of social biases may producediscriminatory, unethical and untrustworthy consequences. It is often assumedthat social biases stem from supervised learning on labelled data, and thus,Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) wrongly appears as an efficient and bias-freesolution, as it does not require labelled data. However, it was recently proventhat a popular SSL method also incorporates biases. In this paper, we study thebiases of a varied set of SSL visual models, trained using ImageNet data, usinga method and dataset designed by psychological experts to measure socialbiases. We show that there is a correlation between the type of the SSL modeland the number of biases that it incorporates. Furthermore, the results alsosuggest that this number does not strictly depend on the model's accuracy andchanges throughout the network. Finally, we conclude that a careful SSL modelselection process can reduce the number of social biases in the deployed model,whilst keeping high performance.

9,Efficient Video Instance Segmentation via Tracklet Query and Proposal,Jialian Wu Sudhir Yarram Hui Liang Tian Lan Junsong Yuan Jayan Eledath Gerard Medioni,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) aims to simultaneously classify, segment,and track multiple object instances in videos. Recent clip-level VIS takes ashort video clip as input each time showing stronger performance thanframe-level VIS (tracking-by-segmentation), as more temporal context frommultiple frames is utilized. Yet, most clip-level methods are neitherend-to-end learnable nor real-time. These limitations are addressed by therecent VIS transformer (VisTR) which performs VIS end-to-end within a clip.However, VisTR suffers from long training time due to its frame-wise denseattention. In addition, VisTR is not fully end-to-end learnable in multiplevideo clips as it requires a hand-crafted data association to link instancetracklets between successive clips. This paper proposes EfficientVIS, a fullyend-to-end framework with efficient training and inference. At the core aretracklet query and tracklet proposal that associate and segmentregions-of-interest (RoIs) across space and time by an iterative query-videointeraction. We further propose a correspondence learning that makes trackletslinking between clips end-to-end learnable. Compared to VisTR, EfficientVISrequires 15x fewer training epochs while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy onthe YouTube-VIS benchmark. Meanwhile, our method enables whole video instancesegmentation in a single end-to-end pass without data association at all.    ",2022/03/03,Computer Vision,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,STUN SelfTeaching Uncertainty Estimation for Place Recognition,Kaiwen Cai Chris Xiaoxuan Lu Xiaowei Huang,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Robotics (cs.RO),"  Place recognition is key to Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) andspatial perception. However, a place recognition in the wild often suffers fromerroneous predictions due to image variations, e.g., changing viewpoints andstreet appearance. Integrating uncertainty estimation into the life cycle ofplace recognition is a promising method to mitigate the impact of variations onplace recognition performance. However, existing uncertainty estimationapproaches in this vein are either computationally inefficient (e.g., MonteCarlo dropout) or at the cost of dropped accuracy. This paper proposes STUN, aself-teaching framework that learns to simultaneously predict the place andestimate the prediction uncertainty given an input image. To this end, we firsttrain a teacher net using a standard metric learning pipeline to produceembedding priors. Then, supervised by the pretrained teacher net, a student netwith an additional variance branch is trained to finetune the embedding priorsand estimate the uncertainty sample by sample. During the online inferencephase, we only use the student net to generate a place prediction inconjunction with the uncertainty. When compared with place recognition systemsthat are ignorant to the uncertainty, our framework features the uncertaintyestimation for free without sacrificing any prediction accuracy. Ourexperimental results on the large-scale Pittsburgh30k dataset demonstrate thatSTUN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy andthe quality of uncertainty estimation.

11,LGTNet Indoor Panoramic Room Layout Estimation with GeometryAware Transformer Network,Zhigang Jiang Zhongzheng Xiang Jinhua Xu Ming Zhao,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  3D room layout estimation by a single panorama using deep neural networks hasmade great progress. However, previous approaches can not obtain efficientgeometry awareness of room layout with the only latitude of boundaries orhorizon-depth. We present that using horizon-depth along with room height canobtain omnidirectional-geometry awareness of room layout in both horizontal andvertical directions. In addition, we propose a planar-geometry aware lossfunction with normals and gradients of normals to supervise the planeness ofwalls and turning of corners. We propose an efficient network, LGT-Net, forroom layout estimation, which contains a novel Transformer architecture calledSWG Transformer to model geometry relations. SWG Transformer consists of(Shifted) Window Blocks and Global Blocks to combine the local and globalgeometry relations. Moreover, we design a novel relative position embedding ofTransformer to enhance the spatial identification ability for the panorama.Experiments show that the proposed LGT-Net achieves better performance thancurrent state-of-the-arts (SOTA) on benchmark datasets.

12,Adaptive LocalGlobal Relational Network for Facial Action Units Recognition and Facial Paralysis Estimation,Xuri Ge Joemon M Jose Pengcheng Wang Arunachalam Iyer Xiao Liu Hu Han,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Facial action units (AUs) refer to a unique set of facial muscle movements atcertain facial locations defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS),which can be used for describing nearly any anatomically possible facialexpression. Many existing facial action units (AUs) recognition approachesoften enhance the AU representation by combining local features from multipleindependent branches, each corresponding to a different AU, which usuallyneglect potential mutual assistance and exclusion relationship between AUbranches or simply employ a pre-defined and fixed knowledge-graph as a prior.In addition, extracting features from pre-defined AU regions of regular shapeslimits the representation ability. In this paper, we propose a novel AdaptiveLocal-Global Relational Network (ALGRNet) for facial AU recognition and applyit to facial paralysis estimation. ALGRNet mainly consists of three novelstructures, i.e., an adaptive region learning module which learns the adaptivemuscle regions based on the detected landmarks, a skip-BiLSTM module whichmodels the latent mutual assistance and exclusion relationship among local AUfeatures, and a feature fusion\&refining module which explores thecomplementarity between local AUs and the whole face for the local AUrefinement. In order to evaluate our proposed method, we migrated ALGRNet to afacial paralysis dataset which is collected and annotated by medicalprofessionals. Experiments on the BP4D and DISFA AU datasets show that theproposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.Additionally, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed ALGRNet inapplications to facial paralysis estimation.

13,Revisiting Clickbased Interactive Video Object Segmentation,Stephane Vujasinovic Sebastian Bullinger Stefan Becker Norbert SchererNegenborn Michael Arens Rainer Stiefelhagen,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  While current methods for interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) relyon scribble-based interactions to generate precise object masks, we propose aClick-based interactive Video Object Segmentation (CiVOS) framework to simplifythe required user workload as much as possible. CiVOS builds on de-coupledmodules reflecting user interaction and mask propagation. The interactionmodule converts click-based interactions into an object mask, which is theninferred to the remaining frames by the propagation module. Additional userinteractions allow for a refinement of the object mask. The approach isextensively evaluated on the popular interactive~DAVIS dataset, but with aninevitable adaptation of scribble-based interactions with click-basedcounterparts. We consider several strategies for generating clicks during ourevaluation to reflect various user inputs and adjust the DAVIS performancemetric to perform a hardware-independent comparison. The presented CiVOSpipeline achieves competitive results, although requiring a lower userworkload.    ",2022/03/03,Computer Vision,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,PINA Learning a Personalized Implicit Neural Avatar from a Single RGBD Video Sequence,Zijian Dong Chen Guo Jie Song Xu Chen Andreas Geiger Otmar Hilliges,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  We present a novel method to learn Personalized Implicit Neural Avatars(PINA) from a short RGB-D sequence. This allows non-expert users to create adetailed and personalized virtual copy of themselves, which can be animatedwith realistic clothing deformations. PINA does not require complete scans, nordoes it require a prior learned from large datasets of clothed humans. Learninga complete avatar in this setting is challenging, since only few depthobservations are available, which are noisy and incomplete (i.e.only partialvisibility of the body per frame). We propose a method to learn the shape andnon-rigid deformations via a pose-conditioned implicit surface and adeformation field, defined in canonical space. This allows us to fuse allpartial observations into a single consistent canonical representation. Fusionis formulated as a global optimization problem over the pose, shape andskinning parameters. The method can learn neural avatars from real noisy RGB-Dsequences for a diverse set of people and clothing styles and these avatars canbe animated given unseen motion sequences.

15,ModalityAdaptive Mixup and Invariant Decomposition for RGBInfrared Person ReIdentification,Zhipeng Huang Jiawei Liu Liang Li Kecheng Zheng ZhengJun Zha,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  RGB-infrared person re-identification is an emerging cross-modalityre-identification task, which is very challenging due to significant modalitydiscrepancy between RGB and infrared images. In this work, we propose a novelmodality-adaptive mixup and invariant decomposition (MID) approach forRGB-infrared person re-identification towards learning modality-invariant anddiscriminative representations. MID designs a modality-adaptive mixup scheme togenerate suitable mixed modality images between RGB and infrared images formitigating the inherent modality discrepancy at the pixel-level. It formulatesmodality mixup procedure as Markov decision process, where an actor-criticagent learns dynamical and local linear interpolation policy between differentregions of cross-modality images under a deep reinforcement learning framework.Such policy guarantees modality-invariance in a more continuous latent spaceand avoids manifold intrusion by the corrupted mixed modality samples.Moreover, to further counter modality discrepancy and enforce invariant visualsemantics at the feature-level, MID employs modality-adaptive convolutiondecomposition to disassemble a regular convolution layer into modality-specificbasis layers and a modality-shared coefficient layer. Extensive experimentalresults on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of MIDover state-of-the-art methods.    ",2022/03/03,Computer Vision,147,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,Beyond 3D Siamese Tracking A MotionCentric Paradigm for 3D Single Object Tracking in Point Clouds,Chaoda Zheng Xu Yan Haiming Zhang Baoyuan Wang Shenghui Cheng Shuguang Cui Zhen Li,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  3D single object tracking (3D SOT) in LiDAR point clouds plays a crucial rolein autonomous driving. Current approaches all follow the Siamese paradigm basedon appearance matching. However, LiDAR point clouds are usually textureless andincomplete, which hinders effective appearance matching. Besides, previousmethods greatly overlook the critical motion clues among targets. In this work,beyond 3D Siamese tracking, we introduce a motion-centric paradigm to handle 3DSOT from a new perspective. Following this paradigm, we propose a matching-freetwo-stage tracker M^2-Track. At the 1^st-stage, M^2-Track localizes the targetwithin successive frames via motion transformation. Then it refines the targetbox through motion-assisted shape completion at the 2^nd-stage. Extensiveexperiments confirm that M^2-Track significantly outperforms previousstate-of-the-arts on three large-scale datasets while running at 57FPS (~8%,~17%, and ~22%) precision gains on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Datasetrespectively). Further analysis verifies each component's effectiveness andshows the motion-centric paradigm's promising potential when combined withappearance matching.

17,Ensembles of Vision Transformers as a New Paradigm for Automated Classification in Ecology,S Kyathanahally T Hardeman M Reyes E Merz T Bulas F Pomati M BaityJesi,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"  Monitoring biodiversity is paramount to manage and protect natural resources,particularly in times of global change. Collecting images of organisms overlarge temporal or spatial scales is a promising practice to monitor and studybiodiversity change of natural ecosystems, providing large amounts of data withminimal interference with the environment. Deep learning models are currentlyused to automate classification of organisms into taxonomic units. However,imprecision in these classifiers introduce a measurement noise that isdifficult to control and can significantly hinder the analysis andinterpretation of data. In our study, we show that this limitation can beovercome by ensembles of Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiTs), whichsignificantly outperform the previous state of the art (SOTA). We validate ourresults on a large number of ecological imaging datasets of diverse origin, andorganisms of study ranging from plankton to insects, birds, dog breeds, animalsin the wild, and corals. On all the data sets we test, we achieve a new SOTA,with a reduction of the error with respect to the previous SOTA ranging from18.48% to 87.50%, depending on the data set, and often achieving performancesvery close to perfect classification. The main reason why ensembles of DeiTsperform better is not due to the single-model performance of DeiTs, but ratherto the fact that predictions by independent models have a smaller overlap, andthis maximizes the profit gained by ensembling. This positions DeiT ensemblesas the best candidate for image classification in biodiversity monitoring.    ",2022/03/03,Computer Vision,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,Debiased Batch Normalization via Gaussian Process for Generalizable Person ReIdentification,Jiawei Liu Zhipeng Huang Liang Li Kecheng Zheng ZhengJun Zha,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Generalizable person re-identification aims to learn a model with onlyseveral labeled source domains that can perform well on unseen domains. Withoutaccess to the unseen domain, the feature statistics of the batch normalization(BN) layer learned from a limited number of source domains is doubtlesslybiased for unseen domain. This would mislead the feature representationlearning for unseen domain and deteriorate the generalizaiton ability of themodel. In this paper, we propose a novel Debiased Batch Normalization viaGaussian Process approach (GDNorm) for generalizable person re-identification,which models the feature statistic estimation from BN layers as a dynamicallyself-refining Gaussian process to alleviate the bias to unseen domain forimproving the generalization. Specifically, we establish a lightweight modelwith multiple set of domain-specific BN layers to capture the discriminabilityof individual source domain, and learn the corresponding parameters of thedomain-specific BN layers. These parameters of different source domains areemployed to deduce a Gaussian process. We randomly sample several paths fromthis Gaussian process served as the BN estimations of potential new domainsoutside of existing source domains, which can further optimize these learnedparameters from source domains, and estimate more accurate Gaussian process bythem in return, tending to real data distribution. Even without a large numberof source domains, GDNorm can still provide debiased BN estimation by using themean path of the Gaussian process, while maintaining low computational costduring testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GDNorm effectivelyimproves the generalization ability of the model on unseen domain.    ",2022/03/03,Computer Vision,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,Weakly Supervised Object Localization as Domain Adaption,Lei Zhu Qi She Qian Chen Yunfei You Boyu Wang Yanye Lu,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"  Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) focuses on localizing objectsonly with the supervision of image-level classification masks. Most previousWSOL methods follow the classification activation map (CAM) that localizesobjects based on the classification structure with the multi-instance learning(MIL) mechanism. However, the MIL mechanism makes CAM only activatediscriminative object parts rather than the whole object, weakening itsperformance for localizing objects. To avoid this problem, this work provides anovel perspective that models WSOL as a domain adaption (DA) task, where thescore estimator trained on the source/image domain is tested on thetarget/pixel domain to locate objects. Under this perspective, a DA-WSOLpipeline is designed to better engage DA approaches into WSOL to enhancelocalization performance. It utilizes a proposed target sampling strategy toselect different types of target samples. Based on these types of targetsamples, domain adaption localization (DAL) loss is elaborated. It aligns thefeature distribution between the two domains by DA and makes the estimatorperceive target domain cues by Universum regularization.

To support this spatial reasoning task,contextual information about the overall shape of an object is critical.However, such information is not captured by established loss terms (e.g. Diceloss). We propose to complement geometrical shape information by includingmulti-scale topological features, such as connected components, cycles, andvoids, in the reconstruction loss. Our method calculates topological featuresfrom 3D volumetric data based on cubical complexes and uses an optimaltransport distance to guide the reconstruction process. This topology-awareloss is fully differentiable, computationally efficient, and can be added toany neural network. We demonstrate the utility of our loss by incorporating itinto SHAPR, a model for predicting the 3D cell shape of individual cells basedon 2D microscopy images. Using a hybrid loss that leverages both geometricaland topological information of single objects to assess their shape, we findthat topological information substantially improves the quality ofreconstructions, thus highlighting its ability to extract more relevantfeatures from image datasets.

However,the important cue of relative distance between landmarks is ignored in CC2D. Inthis paper, we upgrade CC2D to version II by incorporating asimple-yet-effective relative distance bias in the training stage, which istheoretically proved to encourage the encoder to project the relatively distantlandmarks to the embeddings with low similarities. As consequence, CC2Dv2 isless possible to detect a wrong point far from the correct landmark.Furthermore, we present an open-source, landmark-labeled dataset for themeasurement of biomechanical parameters of the lower extremity to alleviate theburden of orthopedic surgeons. The effectiveness of CC2Dv2 is evaluated on thepublic dataset from the ISBI 2015 Grand-Challenge of cephalometric radiographsand our new dataset, which greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art one-shotlandmark detection approaches.

22,Bridging the Sourcetotarget Gap for Crossdomain Person ReIdentification with Intermediate Domains,Yongxing Dai Yifan Sun Jun Liu Zekun Tong Yi Yang LingYu Duan,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Cross-domain person re-identification (re-ID), such as unsupervised domainadaptive (UDA) re-ID, aims to transfer the identity-discriminative knowledgefrom the source to the target domain. Existing methods commonly consider thesource and target domains are isolated from each other, i.e., no intermediatestatus is modeled between both domains. Directly transferring the knowledgebetween two isolated domains can be very difficult, especially when the domaingap is large. From a novel perspective, we assume these two domains are notcompletely isolated, but can be connected through intermediate domains. Insteadof directly aligning the source and target domains against each other, wepropose to align the source and target domains against their intermediatedomains for a smooth knowledge transfer. To discover and utilize theseintermediate domains, we propose an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) and aMirrors Generation Module (MGM). IDM has two functions: 1) it generatesmultiple intermediate domains by mixing the hidden-layer features from sourceand target domains and 2) it dynamically reduces the domain gap between thesource / target domain features and the intermediate domain features. While IDMachieves good domain alignment, it introduces a side effect, i.e., the mix-upoperation may mix the identities into a new identity and lose the originalidentities. To compensate this, MGM is introduced by mapping the features intothe IDM-generated intermediate domains without changing their originalidentity. It allows to focus on minimizing domain variations to promote thealignment between the source / target domain and intermediate domains, whichreinforces IDM into IDM++. We extensively evaluate our method under both theUDA and domain generalization (DG) scenarios and observe that IDM++ yieldsconsistent performance improvement for cross-domain re-ID, achieving new stateof the art.

23,CrossModality Earth Movers Distance for Visible Thermal Person ReIdentification,Yongguo Ling Zhun Zhong Donglin Cao Zhiming Luo Yaojin Lin Shaozi Li Nicu Sebe,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Visible thermal person re-identification (VT-ReID) suffers from theinter-modality discrepancy and intra-identity variations. Distributionalignment is a popular solution for VT-ReID, which, however, is usuallyrestricted to the influence of the intra-identity variations. In this paper, wepropose the Cross-Modality Earth Mover's Distance (CM-EMD) that can alleviatethe impact of the intra-identity variations during modality alignment. CM-EMDselects an optimal transport strategy and assigns high weights to pairs thathave a smaller intra-identity variation. In this manner, the model will focuson reducing the inter-modality discrepancy while paying less attention tointra-identity variations, leading to a more effective modality alignment.Moreover, we introduce two techniques to improve the advantage of CM-EMD.First, the Cross-Modality Discrimination Learning (CM-DL) is designed toovercome the discrimination degradation problem caused by modality alignment.By reducing the ratio between intra-identity and inter-identity variances,CM-DL leads the model to learn more discriminative representations.

24,CorrelationAware Deep Tracking,Fei Xie Chunyu Wang Guangting Wang Yue Cao Wankou Yang Wenjun Zeng,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"  Robustness and discrimination power are two fundamental requirements invisual object tracking. In most tracking paradigms, we find that the featuresextracted by the popular Siamese-like networks cannot fully discriminativelymodel the tracked targets and distractor objects, hindering them fromsimultaneously meeting these two requirements. While most methods focus ondesigning robust correlation operations, we propose a novel target-dependentfeature network inspired by the self-/cross-attention scheme. In contrast tothe Siamese-like feature extraction, our network deeply embeds cross-imagefeature correlation in multiple layers of the feature network. By extensivelymatching the features of the two images through multiple layers, it is able tosuppress non-target features, resulting in instance-varying feature extraction.The output features of the search image can be directly used for predictingtarget locations without extra correlation step. Moreover, our model can beflexibly pre-trained on abundant unpaired images, leading to notably fasterconvergence than the existing methods. Extensive experiments show our methodachieves the state-of-the-art results while running at real-time. Our featurenetworks also can be applied to existing tracking pipelines seamlessly to raisethe tracking performance. Code will be available.    ",2022/03/03,Computer Vision,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many applications, the usage ofunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring and remote sensing is rapidlygaining momentum due to their high mobility, low cost, and flexible deployment.A key challenge is planning missions to maximize the value of acquired data inlarge environments given flight time limitations. This is, for example,relevant for monitoring agricultural fields. This paper addresses the problemof adaptive path planning for accurate semantic segmentation of using UAVs. Wepropose an online planning algorithm which adapts the UAV paths to obtainhigh-resolution semantic segmentations necessary in areas with fine details asthey are detected in incoming images. This enables us to perform closeinspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting energy onexhaustive mapping at maximum image resolution. A key feature of our approachis a new accuracy model for deep learning-based architectures that captures therelationship between UAV altitude and semantic segmentation accuracy. Weevaluate our approach on different domains using real-world data, proving theefficacy and generability of our solution.    ",2022/03/03,Computer Vision,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,Improved Approximation Algorithms and Lower Bounds for SearchDiversification Problems,Amir Abboud Vincent CohenAddad Euiwoong Lee Pasin Manurangsi,Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),"  We study several questions related to diversifying search results. We giveimproved approximation algorithms in each of the following problems, togetherwith some lower bounds.- We give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for a diversifiedsearch ranking problem [Bansal et al., ICALP 2010] whose objective is tominimizes the discounted cumulative gain. Our PTAS runs in time$n^{2^{O(\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)}} \cdot m^{O(1)}$ where $n$ denotes thenumber of elements in the databases. Complementing this, we show that no PTAScan run in time $f(\epsilon) \cdot (nm)^{2^{o(1/\epsilon)}}$ assuming Gap-ETH;therefore our running time is nearly tight. Both of our bounds answer openquestions of Bansal et al.- We next consider the Max-Sum Dispersion problem, whose objective is toselect $k$ out of $n$ elements that maximizes the dispersion, which is definedas the sum of the pairwise distances under a given metric. We give aquasipolynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem which runs in time$n^{O_{\epsilon}(\log n)}$. This improves upon previously known polynomial-timealgorithms with approximate ratios 0.5 [Hassin et al., Oper. Res. Lett. 1997;Borodin et al., ACM Trans. Algorithms 2017]. Furthermore, we observe that knownreductions rule out approximation schemes that run in$n^{\tilde{o}_\epsilon(\log n)}$ time assuming ETH.- We consider a generalization of Max-Sum Dispersion called Max-SumDiversification. In addition to the sum of pairwise distance, the objectiveincludes another function $f$. For monotone submodular $f$, we give aquasipolynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio arbitrarily close to$(1 - 1/e)$. This improves upon the best polynomial-time algorithm which hasapproximation ratio $0.5$ by Borodin et al. Furthermore, the $(1 - 1/e)$ factoris tight as achieving better-than-$(1 - 1/e)$ approximation is NP-hard [Feige,J. ACM 1998].    ",2022/03/03,Data Structures,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,High Multiplicity Scheduling on Uniform Machines in FPTTime,Hauke Brinkop Klaus Jansen,Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),"  In high-multiplicity scheduling, jobs of the same size are encoded in anefficient way, that is, for each size the number of jobs of that size is giveninstead of a list of jobs. Similarly, machines are encoded. We considerscheduling on uniform machines where a job of size $p_j$ takes time $p_j/s_i$on a machine of speed $s_i$. Classical (NP-hard) objectives are Makespanminimization ($C_{\max}$) and Santa Claus ($C_{\min}$). We show that bothobjectives can be solved in time $\mathcal O( p_{\max}^{\mathcal O(d^2)}\operatorname {poly} |I| )$ where $p_{\max}$ is the largest jobs size, $d$ thenumber of different job sizes and $|I|$ the encoding length of the instance.Our approach incorporates two structural theorems: The first allows us toreplace machines of large speed by multiple machines of smaller speed. Thesecond tells us that some fractional assignments can be used to reduce theinstance significantly. Using only the first theorem, we show some additionalresults. For the problem Envy Minimization ($C_{\mathit{envy}}$), we propose an$\mathcal O(s_{\max} \cdot p_{\max}^{\mathcal O(d^3)} \operatorname{poly} |I|)$time algorithm (where $s_{\max}$ is the largest speed). For $C_{\max}$ and$C_{\min}$ in the Restricted Assignment setting, we give an $\mathcal O( (dp_{\max})^{\mathcal O(d^3)} \operatorname{poly} |I|)$ time algorithm. As far aswe know, those running times are better than the running times of thealgorithms known until today.    ",2022/03/03,Data Structures,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, for $d$-dimensional Gaussiandistributions with known covariance $\Sigma$, we can test whether thedistribution comes from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ for some fixed $\mu^*$ orfrom some $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ with total variation distance at least$\alpha$ from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ with $(\varepsilon, 0)$-differentialprivacy, using only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} +\frac{d^{1/3}}{\alpha^{4/3} \cdot \varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{1}{\alpha \cdot\varepsilon}\right)\] samples if the algorithm is allowed to be computationallyinefficient, and only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} +\frac{d^{1/4}}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon}\right)\] samples for a computationallyefficient algorithm. We also provide a matching lower bound showing that ourcomputationally inefficient algorithm has optimal sample complexity. We alsoextend our algorithms to various related problems, including mean testing ofGaussians with bounded but unknown covariance, uniformity testing of productdistributions over $\{\pm 1\}^d$, and tolerant testing.Our results improve over the previous best work of Canonne, Kamath, McMillan,Ullman, and Zakynthinou \cite{CanonneKMUZ20} for both computationally efficientand inefficient algorithms, and even our computationally efficient algorithmmatches the optimal \emph{non-private} sample complexity of$O\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\alpha^2}\right)$ in many standard parameter settings.In addition, our results show that, surprisingly, private identity testing of$d$-dimensional Gaussians can be done with fewer samples than private identitytesting of discrete distributions over a domain of size $d$ \cite{AcharyaSZ18},which refutes a conjectured lower bound of Canonne et al. \cite{CanonneKMUZ20}.

30,Uniform Approximations for Randomized Hadamard Transforms with Applications,Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri Jelani Nelson,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computational Geometry (cs.CG); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"  Randomized Hadamard Transforms (RHTs) have emerged as a computationallyefficient alternative to the use of dense unstructured random matrices across arange of domains in computer science and machine learning. For severalapplications such as dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing, thetheoretical guarantees for methods based on RHTs are comparable to approachesusing dense random matrices with i.i.d.\ entries. However, several suchapplications are in the low-dimensional regime where the number of rows sampledfrom the matrix is rather small. Prior arguments are not applicable to thehigh-dimensional regime often found in machine learning applications likekernel approximation. Given an ensemble of RHTs with Gaussian diagonals,$\{M^i\}_{i = 1}^m$, and any $1$-Lipschitz function, $f: \mathbb{R} \to\mathbb{R}$, we prove that the average of $f$ over the entries of $\{M^i v\}_{i= 1}^m$ converges to its expectation uniformly over $\| v \| \leq 1$ at a ratecomparable to that obtained from using truly Gaussian matrices. We use ourinequality to then derive improved guarantees for two applications in thehigh-dimensional regime: 1) kernel approximation and 2) distance estimation.For kernel approximation, we prove the first \emph{uniform} approximationguarantees for random features constructed through RHTs lending theoreticaljustification to their empirical success while for distance estimation, ourconvergence result implies data structures with improved runtime guaranteesover previous work by the authors.

The auctioneer's problem is to chooseprice levels $p_1 > p_2 > \cdots > p_{k}$ for the auction clock such thatauction expected revenue is maximized. The prices levels are announced prior tothe auction. We reduce this problem to a new variant of prophet inequality,which we call \emph{batched prophet inequality}, where a decision-maker chooses$k$ (decreasing) thresholds and then sequentially collects rewards (up to $m$)that are above the thresholds with ties broken uniformly at random. For thespecial case of $m=1$ (i.e., selling a single item), we show that the resultingdescending auction with $k$ price levels achieves $1- 1/e^k$ of theunrestricted (without the bound of $k$) optimal revenue. That means adescending auction with just 4 price levels can achieve more than 98\% of theoptimal revenue. We then extend our results for $m>1$ and provide a closed-formbound on the competitive ratio of our auction as a function of the number ofunits $m$ and the number of price levels $k$.

33,TCal An optimal test for the calibration of predictive models,Donghwan Lee Xinmeng Huang Hamed Hassani Edgar Dobriban,Machine Learning (stat.ML); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"  The prediction accuracy of machine learning methods is steadily increasing,but the calibration of their uncertainty predictions poses a significantchallenge. Numerous works focus on obtaining well-calibrated predictive models,but less is known about reliably assessing model calibration. This limits ourability to know when algorithms for improving calibration have a real effect,and when their improvements are merely artifacts due to random noise in finitedatasets. In this work, we consider detecting mis-calibration of predictivemodels using a finite validation dataset as a hypothesis testing problem. Thenull hypothesis is that the predictive model is calibrated, while thealternative hypothesis is that the deviation from calibration is sufficientlylarge.We find that detecting mis-calibration is only possible when the conditionalprobabilities of the classes are sufficiently smooth functions of thepredictions. When the conditional class probabilities are Hölder continuous,we propose T-Cal, a minimax optimal test for calibration based on a debiasedplug-in estimator of the $\ell_2$-Expected Calibration Error (ECE). We furtherpropose Adaptive T-Cal, a version that is adaptive to unknown smoothness. Weverify our theoretical findings with a broad range of experiments, includingwith several popular deep neural net architectures and several standardpost-hoc calibration methods. T-Cal is a practical general-purpose tool, which-- combined with classical tests for discrete-valued predictors -- can be usedto test the calibration of virtually any probabilistic classification method.

34,Reinforcement Learning in Possibly Nonstationary Environments,Mengbing Li Chengchun Shi Zhenke Wu Piotr Fryzlewicz,Machine Learning (stat.ML); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"  We consider reinforcement learning (RL) methods in offline nonstationaryenvironments. Many existing RL algorithms in the literature rely on thestationarity assumption that requires the system transition and the rewardfunction to be constant over time. However, the stationarity assumption isrestrictive in practice and is likely to be violated in a number ofapplications, including traffic signal control, robotics and mobile health. Inthis paper, we develop a consistent procedure to test the nonstationarity ofthe optimal policy based on pre-collected historical data, without additionalonline data collection. Based on the proposed test, we further develop asequential change point detection method that can be naturally coupled withexisting state-of-the-art RL methods for policy optimisation in nonstationaryenvironments.

35,Estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects with Missing Treatment Information,Milan Kuzmanovic Tobias Hatt Stefan Feuerriegel,Machine Learning (stat.ML); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"  Estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is challenging,especially when treatment information is missing. Although this is a widespreadproblem in practice, CATE estimation with missing treatments has receivedlittle attention. In this paper, we analyze CATE estimation in the setting withmissing treatments where, thus, unique challenges arise in the form ofcovariate shifts. We identify two covariate shifts in our setting: (i) acovariate shift between the treated and control population; and (ii) acovariate shift between the observed and missing treatment population. We firsttheoretically show the effect of these covariate shifts by deriving ageneralization bound for estimating CATE in our setting with missingtreatments. Then, motivated by our bound, we develop the missing treatmentrepresentation network (MTRNet), a novel CATE estimation algorithm that learnsa balanced representation of covariates using domain adaptation. By usingbalanced representations, MTRNet provides more reliable CATE estimates in thecovariate domains where the data are not fully observed. In various experimentswith semi-synthetic and real-world data, we show that our algorithm improvesover the state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.    ",2022/03/02,Machine Learning,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wepropose a novel differentiable relaxation based on homotopy continuation thatmakes it possible to target sparsity by working directly with $L_0$regularization. We identify failure modes for regularized BO and develop ahyperparameter-free method, sparsity exploring Bayesian optimization (SEBO)that seeks to simultaneously maximize a target objective and sparsity.

They can yield systems of quadraticequations that we explicitly solve to obtain one or two solutions for thecausal parameters of adjacent directed edges.

However, understanding the difference in themicrobiome profiles of healthy and ill individuals can be complicated due tothe large number of complex interactions among microbes.

Motivated by the need to analyse such complexinteractions, we develop a method that learns a low-dimensional representationof the time-evolving graph and maintains the dynamics occurring in thehigh-dimensional space. Through our experiments, we show that we can extractgraph features such as clusters of nodes or edges that have the highest impacton the model to learn the low-dimensional representation.

To support this spatial reasoning task,contextual information about the overall shape of an object is critical.However, such information is not captured by established loss terms (e.g. Diceloss).

Our method calculates topological featuresfrom 3D volumetric data based on cubical complexes and uses an optimaltransport distance to guide the reconstruction process. This topology-awareloss is fully differentiable, computationally efficient, and can be added toany neural network. We demonstrate the utility of our loss by incorporating itinto SHAPR, a model for predicting the 3D cell shape of individual cells basedon 2D microscopy images. Using a hybrid loss that leverages both geometricaland topological information of single objects to assess their shape, we findthat topological information substantially improves the quality ofreconstructions, thus highlighting its ability to extract more relevantfeatures from image datasets.

The problem of estimating the joint probability density function(PDF) using semi-parametric techniques such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)is widely studied. However such techniques yield poor results when theunderlying densities are mixtures of various other families of distributionssuch as Laplacian or generalized Gaussian, uniform, Cauchy, etc. Further, GMMsare not the best choice to estimate joint distributions which are hybrid innature, i.e., some random variables are discrete while others are continuous.We present a novel approach for estimating the PDF using ideas from dictionaryrepresentations in signal processing coupled with low rank tensordecompositions.

Is it merely a way to artificiallyaugment the data set size? Or is it about encouraging the model to satisfycertain invariance? In this work we consider another angle, and we study theeffect of data augmentation on the dynamic of the learning process. We findthat data augmentation can alter the relative importance of various features,effectively making certain informative but hard to learn features more likelyto be captured in the learning process. Importantly, we show that this effectis more pronounced for non-linear models, such as neural networks. Our maincontribution is a detailed analysis of data augmentation on the learningdynamic for a two layer convolutional neural network in the recently proposedmulti-view model by Allen-Zhu and Li [2020]. We complement this analysis withfurther experimental evidence that data augmentation can be viewed as a form offeature manipulation.    ",2022/03/03,Machine Learning,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,Representing Mixtures of Word Embeddings with Mixtures of Topic Embeddings,Dongsheng Wang Dandan Guo He Zhao Huangjie Zheng Korawat Tanwisuth Bo Chen Mingyuan Zhou,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Methodology (stat.ME); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"  A topic model is often formulated as a generative model that explains howeach word of a document is generated given a set of topics anddocument-specific topic proportions. It is focused on capturing the wordco-occurrences in a document and hence often suffers from poor performance inanalyzing short documents. In addition, its parameter estimation often relieson approximate posterior inference that is either not scalable or suffers fromlarge approximation error. This paper introduces a new topic-modeling frameworkwhere each document is viewed as a set of word embedding vectors and each topicis modeled as an embedding vector in the same embedding space. Embedding thewords and topics in the same vector space, we define a method to measure thesemantic difference between the embedding vectors of the words of a documentand these of the topics, and optimize the topic embeddings to minimize theexpected difference over all documents. Experiments on text analysisdemonstrate that the proposed method, which is amenable to mini-batchstochastic gradient descent based optimization and hence scalable to bigcorpora, provides competitive performance in discovering more coherent anddiverse topics and extracting better document representations.

First, our proposed algorithmgenerates multiple subsamples of a given size with replacement from theoriginal sample. The subsamples and their constituting data points are regardedas $\it{chromosome}$ and $\it{gene}$, respectively, in the terminology ofgenetic algorithm. Second, each pair of subsamples breeds two new subsamples,where each data point faces either $\it{crossover}$, $\it{mutation}$, or$\it{reproduction}$ with a certain probability. The dominant subsamples interms of fitness values are inherited by the next generation. This process isrepeated generation by generation and brings the sparse representation ofkernel density estimator in its completion. We confirmed from simulationstudies that the resulting estimator can perform better than other well-knowndensity estimators.    ",2022/03/03,Machine Learning,137,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,Largescale Optimization of Partial AUC in a Range of False Positive Rates,Yao Yao Qihang Lin Tianbao Yang,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"  The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is one of the most widely used performancemeasures for classification models in machine learning. However, it summarizesthe true positive rates (TPRs) over all false positive rates (FPRs) in the ROCspace, which may include the FPRs with no practical relevance in someapplications. The partial AUC, as a generalization of the AUC, summarizes onlythe TPRs over a specific range of the FPRs and is thus a more suitableperformance measure in many real-world situations. Although partial AUCoptimization in a range of FPRs had been studied, existing algorithms are notscalable to big data and not applicable to deep learning. To address thischallenge, we cast the problem into a non-smooth difference-of-convex (DC)program for any smooth predictive functions (e.g., deep neural networks), whichallowed us to develop an efficient approximated gradient descent method basedon the Moreau envelope smoothing technique, inspired by recent advances innon-smooth DC optimization. To increase the efficiency of large dataprocessing, we used an efficient stochastic block coordinate update in ouralgorithm. Our proposed algorithm can also be used to minimize the sum ofranked range loss, which also lacks efficient solvers. We established acomplexity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ for finding a nearly $\epsilon$-criticalsolution. Finally, we numerically demonstrated the effectiveness of ourproposed algorithms for both partial AUC maximization and sum of ranked rangeloss minimization.

At the core of Bayesian optimization is a surrogate model thatpredicts the output of the target function at previously unseen inputs tofacilitate the selection of promising input values. Gaussian processes (GPs)are commonly used as surrogate models but are known to scale poorly with thenumber of observations. We adapt the Vecchia approximation, a popular GPapproximation from spatial statistics, to enable scalable high-dimensionalBayesian optimization. We develop several improvements and extensions,including training warped GPs using mini-batch gradient descent, approximateneighbor search, and selecting multiple input values in parallel. We focus onthe use of our warped Vecchia GP in trust-region Bayesian optimization viaThompson sampling. On several test functions and on two reinforcement-learningproblems, our methods compared favorably to the state of the art.    ",2022/03/02,Machine Learning,150,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However,there is still a wide range of domains inaccessible to RL due to the high costand danger of interacting with the environment. Offline RL is a paradigm thatlearns exclusively from static datasets of previously collected interactions,making it feasible to extract policies from large and diverse trainingdatasets. Effective offline RL algorithms have a much wider range ofapplications than online RL, being particularly appealing for real-worldapplications such as education, healthcare, and robotics. In this work, wepropose a unifying taxonomy to classify offline RL methods. Furthermore, weprovide a comprehensive review of the latest algorithmic breakthroughs in thefield, and a review of existing benchmarks' properties and shortcomings.Finally, we provide our perspective on open problems and propose futureresearch directions for this rapidly growing field.

Yet, manyinteresting questions in science and engineering involve situations whereinitially no data are available and the principal aim is to gather insightsfrom a known model. Here we consider this problem in the context of systemswhose evolution can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Weuse deep learning to solve these equations by generating data on-the-fly whenand where they are needed, without prior information about the solution. Theproposed Neural Galerkin schemes derive nonlinear dynamical equations for thenetwork weights by minimization of the residual of the time derivative of thesolution, and solve these equations using standard integrators for initialvalue problems. The sequential learning of the weights over time allows foradaptive collection of new input data for residual estimation. This step usesimportance sampling informed by the current state of the solution, in contrastwith other machine learning methods for PDEs that optimize the networkparameters globally in time. This active form of data acquisition is essentialto enable the approximation power of the neural networks and to break the curseof dimensionality faced by non-adaptative learning strategies. Theapplicability of the method is illustrated on several numerical examplesinvolving high-dimensional PDEs, including advection equations with manyvariables, as well as Fokker-Planck equations for systems with severalinteracting particles.

In this paper, westudy license use and license incompatibilities between all components fromseven package registries (Cargo, Maven, NPM, NuGet, Packagist, PyPI, RubyGems)with a closer investigation of license incompatibilities caused by the GNUAffero General Public License (AGPL). We find that the relative amount of usedlicenses vary between ecosystems (permissive licenses such as MIT and Apacheare most frequent), that the number of direct license incompatibilities rangesfrom low 2.3% in Cargo to a large 20.8% in PyPI, that only a low amount ofdirect license incompatibilities are caused by AGPL licenses (max. 0.04% inPyPI), but that a whopping 6.62% of Maven packages are violating the AGPLlicense of an indirect dependency. Our results suggest that it is not toounlikely that applications that are reusing packages from PyPI or Maven areconfronted with license incompatibilities that could mean that applicationswould have to be open-sourced on distribution (PyPI) or as soon as they arepublicly available as web-applications (Maven).

Gramine Library OS facilitates execution of existingunmodified applications in SGX enclaves, requiring only an accompanyingmanifest file that describes the application's security posture andconfiguration. However, Intel SGX is a CPU-only technology, thus Graminecurrently supports CPU-only workloads. To enable a broader class ofapplications that offload computations to hardware accelerators - GPU offload,NIC offload, FPGA offload, TPM communications - Gramine must be augmented withdevice-backed mmap support and generic ioctl support. In this paper, wedescribe the design and implementation of this newly added support, thecorresponding changes to the manifest-file syntax and the requisite deep copyalgorithm. We evaluate our implementation on Intel Media SDK workloads anddiscuss the encountered caveats and limitations.

The key challenge comes from the little controllabilityin updating DNNs. Retraining to fix some behavior often has a destructiveimpact on other behavior, causing regressions, i.e., the updated DNN fails withinputs correctly handled by the original one. This problem is crucial whenengineers are required to investigate failures in intensive assuranceactivities for safety or trust. Search-based repair techniques for DNNs havepotentials to tackle this challenge by enabling localized updates only on""responsible parameters"" inside the DNN. However, the potentials have not beenexplored to realize sufficient controllability to suppress regressions in DNNrepair tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel DNN repair method that makesuse of the training history for judging which DNN parameters should be changedor not to suppress regressions. We implemented the method into a tool calledNeuRecover and evaluated it with three datasets. Our method outperformed theexisting method by achieving often less than a quarter, even a tenth in somecases, number of regressions. Our method is especially effective when therepair requirements are tight to fix specific failure types. In such cases, ourmethod showed stably low rates (<2%) of regressions, which were in many cases atenth of regressions caused by retraining.    ",2022/03/01,Software Engineering,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite considerable progress in this area, evaluating thequality of explanations remains a significant challenge for researchers andpractitioners. Prior work mainly conducts human study to evaluate explanationquality, which is usually expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human bias.In this paper, we propose an offline evaluation method that can be computedwithout human involvement. To evaluate an explanation, our method quantifiesits counterfactual impact on the recommendation. To validate the effectivenessof our method, we carry out an online user study. We show that, compared toconventional methods, our method can produce evaluation scores more correlatedwith the real human judgments, and therefore can serve as a better proxy forhuman evaluation. In addition, we show that explanations with high evaluationscores are considered better by humans. Our findings highlight the promisingdirection of using the counterfactual approach as one possible way to evaluaterecommendation explanations.

61,Analytical Solutions for the Inverse Problem within Gradual Semantics,Nir Oren Bruno Yun Assaf Libman Murilo S Baptista,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"  Gradual semantics within abstract argumentation associate a numeric scorewith every argument in a system, which represents the level of acceptability ofthis argument, and from which a preference ordering over arguments can bederived. While some semantics operate over standard argumentation frameworks,many utilise a weighted framework, where a numeric initial weight is associatedwith each argument. Recent work has examined the inverse problem within gradualsemantics. Rather than determining a preference ordering given an argumentationframework and a semantics, the inverse problem takes an argumentationframework, a gradual semantics, and a preference ordering as inputs, andidentifies what weights are needed to over arguments in the framework to obtainthe desired preference ordering. Existing work has attacked the inverse problemnumerically, using a root finding algorithm (the bisection method) to identifyappropriate initial weights. In this paper we demonstrate that for a class ofgradual semantics, an analytical approach can be used to solve the inverseproblem. Unlike the current state-of-the-art, such an analytic approach canrapidly find a solution, and is guaranteed to do so. In obtaining this result,we are able to prove several important properties which previous work had posedas conjectures.    ",2022/03/02,Artificial Intelligence,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there does not exist amechanism to directly control the model's focus. This work aims to develop acontrol mechanism by which a user can select spans of context as ""highlights""for the model to focus on, and generate relevant output. To achieve this goal,we augment a pretrained model with trainable ""focus vectors"" that are directlyapplied to the model's embeddings, while the model itself is kept fixed. Thesevectors, trained on automatic annotations derived from attribution methods, actas indicators for context importance. We test our approach on two coregeneration tasks: dialogue response generation and abstractive summarization.We also collect evaluation data where the highlight-generation pairs areannotated by humans. Our experiments show that the trained focus vectors areeffective in steering the model to generate outputs that are relevant touser-selected highlights.

In onlineshopping platform Taobao, we built a billion-scale e-commerce product knowledgegraph. It organizes data uniformly and provides item knowledge services forvarious tasks such as item recommendation. Usually, such knowledge services areprovided through triple data, while this implementation includes (1) tediousdata selection works on product knowledge graph and (2) task model designingworks to infuse those triples knowledge. More importantly, product knowledgegraph is far from complete, resulting error propagation to knowledge enhancedtasks. To avoid these problems, we propose a Pre-trained Knowledge Graph Model(PKGM) for the billion-scale product knowledge graph. On the one hand, it couldprovide item knowledge services in a uniform way with service vectors forembedding-based and item-knowledge-related task models without accessing tripledata. On the other hand, it's service is provided based on implicitly completedproduct knowledge graph, overcoming the common the incomplete issue. We alsopropose two general ways to integrate the service vectors from PKGM intodownstream task models.

However, current verification toolsare limited to only a handful of properties that can be expressed asfirst-order constraints over the inputs and output of a network. Whileadversarial robustness and fairness fall under this category, many real-worldproperties (e.g., ""an autonomous vehicle has to stop in front of a stop sign"")remain outside the scope of existing verification technology. To mitigate thissevere practical restriction, we introduce a novel framework for verifyingneural networks, named neuro-symbolic verification. The key idea is to useneural networks as part of the otherwise logical specification, enabling theverification of a wide variety of complex, real-world properties, including theone above.

Whilerecent research has begun to explore the design of more general-purposemultimodal models (contrary to prior focus on domain and modality-specificarchitectures), these methods are still largely focused on a small set ofmodalities in the language, vision, and audio space. In order to accelerategeneralization towards diverse and understudied modalities, we investigatemethods for high-modality (a large set of diverse modalities) andpartially-observable (each task only defined on a small subset of modalities)scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we design a general multimodal modelthat enables multitask and transfer learning: multitask learning with sharedparameters enables stable parameter counts (addressing scalability), andcross-modal transfer learning enables information sharing across modalities andtasks (addressing partial observability). Our resulting model generalizesacross text, image, video, audio, time-series, sensors, tables, and setmodalities from different research areas, improves the tradeoff betweenperformance and efficiency, transfers to new modalities and tasks, and revealssurprising insights on the nature of information sharing in multitask models.We release our code and benchmarks which we hope will present a unifiedplatform for subsequent theoretical and empirical analysis:this https URL.

When analyzingsurveys with open-ended textual responses, it is extremely time-consuming,labor-intensive, and difficult to manually process all the responses into aninsightful and comprehensive report. In the analysis step, traditionally, theteacher has to read each of the responses and decide on how to group them inorder to extract insightful information. Even though it is possible to groupthe responses only using certain keywords, such an approach would be limitedsince it not only fails to account for embedded contexts but also cannot detectpolysemous words or phrases and semantics that are not expressible in singlewords. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end context-aware framework thatextracts, aggregates, and abbreviates embedded semantic patterns inopen-response survey data. Our framework relies on a pre-trained naturallanguage model in order to encode the textual data into semantic vectors. Theencoded vectors then get clustered either into an optimally tuned number ofgroups or into a set of groups with pre-specified titles. In the former case,the clusters are then further analyzed to extract a representative set ofkeywords or summary sentences that serve as the labels of the clusters. In ourframework, for the designated clusters, we finally provide context-awarewordclouds that demonstrate the semantically prominent keywords within eachgroup. Honoring user privacy, we have successfully built the on-deviceimplementation of our framework suitable for real-time analysis on mobiledevices and have tested it on a synthetic dataset.

This is remedied by amyriad of methods involving human sensing or intention decoding, as well ashuman-robot turn-taking and sequential task planning. However, the physicalinteraction establishes a rich channel of communication through forces, torquesand haptics in general, which is often overlooked in industrial implementationsof human-robot interaction. In this work, we investigate the role of haptics inhuman collaborative physical tasks, to identify how to integrate physicalcommunication in human-robot teams. We present a task to balance a ball at atarget position on a board either bimanually by one participant, or dyadicallyby two participants, with and without haptic information. The task requiresthat the two sides coordinate with each other, in real-time, to balance theball at the target. We found that with training the completion time and numberof velocity peaks of the ball decreased, and that participants gradually becameconsistent in their braking strategy. Moreover we found that the presence ofhaptic information improved the performance (decreased completion time) and ledto an increase in overall cooperative movements. Overall, our results show thathumans can better coordinate with one another when haptic feedback isavailable. These results also highlight the likely importance of hapticcommunication in human-robot physical interaction, both as a tool to inferhuman intentions and to make the robot behaviour interpretable to humans.

Weintroduce WaveY-Net, a hybrid data- and physics-augmented convolutional neuralnetwork that can predict electromagnetic field distributions with ultra fastspeeds and high accuracy for entire classes of dielectric photonic structures.This accuracy is achieved by training the neural network to learn only themagnetic near-field distributions of a system and to use a discrete formalismof Maxwell's equations in two ways: as physical constraints in the lossfunction and as a means to calculate the electric fields from the magneticfields. As a model system, we construct a surrogate simulator for periodicsilicon nanostructure arrays and show that the high speed simulator can bedirectly and effectively used in the local and global freeform optimization ofmetagratings. We anticipate that physics-augmented networks will serve as aviable Maxwell simulator replacement for many classes of photonic systems,transforming the way they are designed.

This phenomenon is called Neural Collapse (NC), which seems to takeplace regardless of the choice of loss functions. In this work, we justify NCunder the mean squared error (MSE) loss, where recent empirical evidence showsthat it performs comparably or even better than the de-facto cross-entropyloss. Under a simplified unconstrained feature model, we provide the firstglobal landscape analysis for vanilla nonconvex MSE loss and show that the(only!) global minimizers are neural collapse solutions, while all othercritical points are strict saddles whose Hessian exhibit negative curvaturedirections. Furthermore, we justify the usage of rescaled MSE loss by probingthe optimization landscape around the NC solutions, showing that the landscapecan be improved by tuning the rescaling hyperparameters. Finally, ourtheoretical findings are experimentally verified on practical networkarchitectures.    ",2022/03/02,Artificial Intelligence,120,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While equivalence testing is becoming morepopular than difference detection (Student's t-test), the former is much moredifficult to pass to ensure low user risk. On the other hand, recentdevelopments in artificial intelligence have led to algorithms that promisemuch higher counting quality (lower bias). However, gradient-based methods(including Deep Learning) have one limitation: they typically run into localoptima. In this work, we explore and exploit various aspects of machinelearning to increase reliability, performance, and counting quality. We performa grid search with several fundamental parameters: the selection and size ofthe training set, which is similar to cross-validation, and the initial networkweights and randomness during the training process. Using this experiment, weshow how aggregation techniques such as ensemble quantiles can reduce bias, andwe give an idea of the overall spread of the results. We utilize the testsuccess chance, a simulative metric based on the empirical distribution.

It can decompose an original matrix into central tensors (containingthe core information) and auxiliary tensors (with only a small proportion ofparameters). With the decomposed MPO structure, we can reduce the parameters ofthe original MoE architecture by sharing a global central tensor across expertsand keeping expert-specific auxiliary tensors. We also design the gradient maskstrategy for the tensor structure of MPO to alleviate the overfitting problem.Experiments on the three well-known downstream natural language datasets basedon GPT2 show improved performance and efficiency in increasing model capacity(7.26x fewer parameters with the same amount of experts).

The combination of satellite imagery and machine learninghas the capability to estimate poverty at a level similar to what is achievedwith workhorse methods such as face-to-face interviews and household surveys.An increasingly important issue beyond static estimations is whether thistechnology can contribute to scientific discovery and consequently newknowledge in the poverty and welfare domain. A foundation for achievingscientific insights is domain knowledge, which in turn translates intoexplainability and scientific consistency. We review the literature focusing onthree core elements relevant in this context: transparency, interpretability,and explainability and investigate how they relates to the poverty, machinelearning and satellite imagery nexus. Our review of the field shows that thestatus of the three core elements of explainable machine learning(transparency, interpretability and domain knowledge) is varied and does notcompletely fulfill the requirements set up for scientific insights anddiscoveries. We argue that explainability is essential to support widerdissemination and acceptance of this research, and explainability means morethan just interpretability.

Using Technology threatavoidance theory (TTAT), this study assessed factors that influenced mobiledevice users' threat avoidance motivations and behaviors as it relates tophishing attacks. From the data collected from 137 mobile device users using aquestionnaire, the findings indicate that (1) mobile device users' perceivedsusceptibility and severity of phishing attacks have a significant correlationwith a users' perception of the threat; (2) mobile device users' motivation toavoid a threat is correlated to a users' behavior in avoiding threat; and (3) amobile device user's susceptibility to phishing attacks can be reduced by theirperception of the threat.

Gramine Library OS facilitates execution of existingunmodified applications in SGX enclaves, requiring only an accompanyingmanifest file that describes the application's security posture andconfiguration. However, Intel SGX is a CPU-only technology, thus Graminecurrently supports CPU-only workloads. To enable a broader class ofapplications that offload computations to hardware accelerators - GPU offload,NIC offload, FPGA offload, TPM communications - Gramine must be augmented withdevice-backed mmap support and generic ioctl support.

Such malicious activitiescan negatively impact the trustworthiness of users identities. On the otherhand, the recent development of GAN models may create high-quality face imageswithout evidence of spatial artifacts. Therefore, reassembling uniform colorchannel correlations is a challenging research problem. To face thesechallenges, we need to develop efficient tools able to differentiate betweenfake and authentic face images. In this chapter, we propose a new strategy todifferentiate GAN-generated images from authentic images by leveraging spectralband discrepancies, focusing on artificial face image synthesis. In particular,we enable the digital preservation of face images using the Cross-bandco-occurrence matrix and spatial co-occurrence matrix. Then, we implement thesetechniques and feed them to a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectureto identify the real from artificial faces. Additionally, we show that theperformance boost is particularly significant and achieves more than 92% indifferent post-processing environments.

There is evidence that generic advice to device owners toaddress IoT malware can be successful, but this does not account for emergingforms of persistent IoT malware. Less is known about persistent malware, whichresides on persistent storage, requiring targeted manual effort to remove it.This paper presents a field study on the removal of persistent IoT malware byconsumers. We partnered with an ISP to contrast remediation times of 760customers across three malware categories: Windows malware, non-persistent IoTmalware, and persistent IoT malware. We also contacted ISP customers identifiedas having persistent IoT malware on their network-attached storage devices,specifically QSnatch. We found that persistent IoT malware exhibits a meaninfection duration many times higher than Windows or Mirai malware; QSnatch hasa survival probability of 30% after 180 days, whereby most if not all otherobserved malware types have been removed. For interviewed device users, QSnatchinfections lasted longer, so are apparently more difficult to get rid of, yetparticipants did not report experiencing difficulty in following notificationinstructions. We see two factors driving this paradoxical finding: First, mostusers reported having high technical competency. Also, we found evidence ofplanning behavior for these tasks and the need for multiple notifications. Ourfindings demonstrate the critical nature of interventions from outside forpersistent malware, since automatic scan of an AV tool or a power cycle, likewe are used to for Windows malware and Mirai infections, will not solvepersistent IoT malware infections.",3/3/2022,Cryptography and Security,137,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These authorities may misissuecertificates or suffer misuse attacks, however, which has given rise to theCertificate Transparency (CT) project. The goal of CT is to store all issuedcertificates in public logs, which can then be checked for the presence ofpotentially misissued certificates. Thus, the requirement that a givencertificate is indeed in one (or several) of these logs lies at the core of CT.In its current deployment, however, most individual clients do not check thatthe certificates they see are in logs, as requesting a proof of inclusiondirectly reveals the certificate and thus creates the clear potential for aviolation of that client's privacy. In this paper, we explore the techniquesthat have been proposed for privacy-preserving auditing of certificateinclusion, focusing on their effectiveness, efficiency, and suitability in anear-term deployment. In doing so, we also explore the parallels with relatedproblems involving browser clients. Guided by a set of constraints that wedevelop, we ultimately observe several key limitations in many proposals,ranging from their privacy provisions to the fact that they focus on theinteraction between a client and a log but leave open the question of how aclient could privately report any certificates that are missing.",3/3/2022,Cryptography and Security,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,

97,Quantum Proofs of Deletion for Learning with Errors,Alexander Poremba,Quantum Physics (quant-ph); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),"Quantum information has the property that measurement is an inherentlydestructive process. This feature is most apparent in the principle ofcomplementarity, which states that mutually incompatible observables cannot bemeasured at the same time. Recent work by Broadbent and Islam (TCC 2020) buildson this aspect of quantum mechanics to realize a cryptographic notion calledcertified deletion. While this remarkable notion enables a classical verifierto be convinced that a (private-key) quantum ciphertext has been deleted by anuntrusted party, it offers no additional layer of functionality.In this work, we augment the proof-of-deletion paradigm with fullyhomomorphic encryption (FHE). This results in a new and powerful cryptographicnotion called fully homomorphic encryption with certified deletion -- aninteractive protocol which enables an untrusted quantum server to compute onencrypted data and, if requested, to simultaneously prove data deletion to aclient. Our main technical ingredient is an interactive protocol by which aquantum prover can convince a classical verifier that a sample from theLearning with Errors (LWE) distribution in the form of a quantum state wasdeleted. We introduce an encoding based on Gaussian coset states which ishighly generic and suggests that essentially any LWE-based cryptographicprimitive admits a classically-verifiable quantum proof of deletion. As anapplication of our protocol, we construct a Dual-Regev public-key encryptionscheme with certified deletion, which we then extend towards a (leveled) FHEscheme of the same type.

Specifically, for $d$-dimensional Gaussiandistributions with known covariance $\Sigma$, we can test whether thedistribution comes from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ for some fixed $\mu^*$ orfrom some $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ with total variation distance at least$\alpha$ from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ with $(\varepsilon, 0)$-differentialprivacy, using only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} +\frac{d^{1/3}}{\alpha^{4/3} \cdot \varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{1}{\alpha \cdot\varepsilon}\right)\] samples if the algorithm is allowed to be computationallyinefficient, and only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} +\frac{d^{1/4}}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon}\right)\] samples for a computationallyefficient algorithm. We also provide a matching lower bound showing that ourcomputationally inefficient algorithm has optimal sample complexity.

As the raw labels often containhighly sensitive information, some recent work has been proposed to prevent thelabel leakage from the backpropagated gradients effectively in vFL. However,these work only identified and defended the threat of label leakage from thebackpropagated gradients. None of these work has paid attention to the problemof label leakage from the intermediate embedding. In this paper, we propose apractical label inference method which can steal private labels effectivelyfrom the shared intermediate embedding even though some existing protectionmethods such as label differential privacy and gradients perturbation areapplied. The effectiveness of the label attack is inseparable from thecorrelation between the intermediate embedding and corresponding privatelabels.

In order to avoidmodel collapse due to excessively hard examples, the existing defenses dismissthe min-max adversarial training, but instead learn from a weak adversaryinefficiently. Conversely, we propose Hardness Manipulation to efficientlyperturb the training triplet till a specified level of hardness for adversarialtraining, according to a harder benign triplet or a pseudo-hardness function.It is flexible since regular training and min-max adversarial training are itsboundary cases. Besides, Gradual Adversary, a family of pseudo-hardnessfunctions is proposed to gradually increase the specified hardness level duringtraining for a better balance between performance and robustness. Additionally,an Intra-Class Structure loss term among benign and adversarial examplesfurther improves model robustness and efficiency. Comprehensive experimentalresults suggest that the proposed method, although simple in its form,overwhelmingly outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses in terms ofrobustness, training efficiency, as well as performance on benign examples.",3/2/2022,Cryptography and Security,81,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most sentiment analysis methods require emotionlabels, which can be obtained through crowdsourcing, where non-expertindividuals contribute to scientific tasks. The text itself has to be exposedto third parties in order to be labelled. In an effort to reduce the exposureof online users' information, we propose a privacy preserving text labellingmethod for varying applications, based in crowdsourcing.

103,Efficient Data Structures for Exploiting Sparsity and Structure in Representation of Polynomial Optimization Problems Implementation in SOSTOOLS,Declan Jagt Sachin Shivakumar Peter Seiler Matthew Peet,Optimization and Control (math.OC); Mathematical Software (cs.MS),"We present a new data structure for representation of polynomial variables inthe parsing of sum-of-squares (SOS) programs. In SOS programs, the variables$s(x;P)$ are polynomial in the independent variables $x$, but linear in thedecision variables $P$. Current SOS parsers, however, fail to exploit thesemi-linear structure of the polynomial variables, treating the decisionvariables as independent variables in their representation. This results inunnecessary overhead in storage and manipulation of the polynomial variables,prohibiting the parser from addressing larger-scale optimization problems. Toeliminate this computational overhead, we introduce a new representation ofpolynomial variables, the ""dpvar"" structure, that is affine in the decisionvariables. We show that the complexity of operations on variables in the dpvarrepresentation scales favorably with the number of decision variables. Wefurther show that the required memory for storing polynomial variables isrelatively small using the dpvar structure, particularly when exploiting theMATLAB sparse storage structure. Finally, we incorporate the dpvar datastructure into SOSTOOLS 4.00, and test the performance of the parser forseveral polynomial optimization problems.",3/3/2022,Math,112,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, making disaggregation practical for productioncloud deployment remains challenging. For example, RDMA-based disaggregationinvolves too much overhead for common workloads and transparent latencymanagement is incompatible with virtualization acceleration. The emergingCompute Express Link (CXL) standard offers a low-overhead substrate to buildmemory disaggregation while overcoming these challenges. This paper proposes afirst-generation CXL-based disaggregation system that meets the requirements ofcloud providers. Our system includes a memory pool controller, andprediction-based system software and distributed control plane designs. Itspredictions of VM latency sensitivity and memory usage allow it to splitworkloads across local and pooled memory while mitigating the higher poollatency.Our analysis of production clusters shows that small pools of 8-32 socketsare sufficient to reduce stranding significantly. It also shows that about 50%of all VMs never touch 50% of their rented memory. In emulated experiments with150+ workloads, we show our pooling approach incurs a configurable performanceloss between 1-5%.

Several dynamical interpretationshave been proposed based on the same logical structure that captures theinteractions between Boolean components. They reproduce, in different degrees,the behaviours emerging in more quantitative models. In particular, regulatoryconflicts can prevent the standard asynchronous dynamics from reproducing sometrajectories that might be expected upon inspection of more detailed models. Weintroduce and study the class of networks with linear cuts, where linearcomponents -- intermediates with a single regulator and a single target --eliminate the aforementioned regulatory conflicts. The interaction graph of aBoolean network admits a linear cut when a linear component occurs in eachcycle and in each path from components with multiple targets to components withmultiple regulators. Under this structural condition the attractors are inone-to-one correspondence with the minimal trap spaces, and the reachability ofattractors can also be easily characterized. Linear cuts provide the base for anew interpretation of the Boolean semantics that captures all behaviours ofmulti-valued refinements with regulatory thresholds that are uniquely definedfor each interaction, and contribute a new approach for the investigation ofbehaviour of logical models.",3/14/2022,Discrete Mathematics,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the axiom gives only a local characterization of therelation of bases, which is a major stumbling block to further progress, andproviding a global understanding of the structure of matroid bases is afundamental goal in matroid optimization.While studying the structure of symmetric exchanges, Gabow proposed theproblem that any pair of bases admits a sequence of symmetric exchanges. Adifferent extension of the exchange axiom was proposed by White, whoinvestigated the equivalence of compatible basis sequences. Farber studied thestructure of basis pairs, and conjectured that the basis pair graph of anymatroid is connected. These conjectures suggest that the family of bases of amatroid possesses much stronger structural properties than we are aware of.In the present paper, we study the distance of basis pairs of a matroid interms of symmetric exchanges. In particular, we give an upper bound on theminimum number of exchanges needed to transform a basis pair into another forsplit matroids, a class that was motivated by the study of matroid polytopesfrom a tropical geometry point of view.

The auctioneer's problem is to chooseprice levels $p_1 > p_2 > \cdots > p_{k}$ for the auction clock such thatauction expected revenue is maximized. The prices levels are announced prior tothe auction. We reduce this problem to a new variant of prophet inequality,which we call \emph{batched prophet inequality}, where a decision-maker chooses$k$ (decreasing) thresholds and then sequentially collects rewards (up to $m$)that are above the thresholds with ties broken uniformly at random. For thespecial case of $m=1$ (i.e., selling a single item), we show that the resultingdescending auction with $k$ price levels achieves $1- 1/e^k$ of theunrestricted (without the bound of $k$) optimal revenue. That means adescending auction with just 4 price levels can achieve more than 98\% of theoptimal revenue.

133,Low complexity equalization for AFDM in doubly dispersive channels,Ali Bemani Nassar Ksairi Marios Kountouris,Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP),"We present Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), a new chirp-basedmulticarrier transceiver scheme for high mobility communications innext-generation wireless systems. AFDM is based on discrete affine Fouriertransform (DAFT), a generalization of discrete Fourier transform characterizedwith two parameters that can be adapted to better cope with doubly dispersivechannels. Based on the derived input-output relation, the DAFT parametersunderlying AFDM are set in such a way to avoid that time domain channel pathswith distinct delays or Doppler frequency shifts overlap in the DAFT domain.The resulting DAFT domain impulse response thus conveys a full delay-Dopplerrepresentation of the channel. We show that AFDM can achieve the full diversityof linear time-varying (LTV) channels. Our analytical results are validatedthrough numerical simulations, which evince that AFDM outperformsstate-of-the-art multicarrier schemes in terms of bit error rate (BER) indoubly dispersive channels.",3/8/2022,Information Theory,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perfectinformation-theoretic privacy requires encoding the input sparse matrices intomatrices distributed uniformly at random from the considered alphabet; thusdestroying the sparsity. Computing matrix-vector multiplication for sparsematrices is known to be fast. Distributing the computation over the non-sparseencoded matrices maintains privacy, but introduces artificial computing delays.In this work, we relax the privacy constraint and show that a certain level ofsparsity can be maintained in the encoded matrices. We consider thechief/worker setting while assuming the presence of two clusters of workers:one is completely untrusted in which all workers collude to eavesdrop on theinput matrix and in which perfect privacy must be satisfied; in the partlytrusted cluster, only up to $z$ workers may collude and to which revealingsmall amount of information about the input matrix is allowed.

We consider both continuous and discretephase shift designs and formulate the codebook construction as optimizationproblems. To solve the optimization problems, we propose an optimal algorithmfor the discrete phaseshift design and a low-complexity sub-optimal solutionfor the continuous design. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithmsfacilitate the construction of codebooks of different sizes and with differentbeamwidths.

In this paper, we investigate the joint design of RISpassive beamforming and subcarrier matching in RIS-assisted orthogonalfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) dual-hop relaying systems under twocases, depending on the presence of the RIS reflected link from the source tothe destination in the first hop. Accordingly, we formulate a mixed-integernonlinear programming (MINIP) problem to maximize the sum achievable rate overall subcarriers by jointly optimizing the RIS passive beamforming andsubcarrier matching. To solve this challenging problem, we first develop abranch-and-bound (BnB)-based alternating optimization algorithm to obtain anear-optimal solution by alternatively optimizing the subcarrier matching bythe BnB method and the RIS passive beamforming by using semidefinite relaxationtechniques. Then, a low-complexity difference-of-convex penalty-based algorithmis proposed to reduce the computation complexity in the BnB method. To furtherreduce the computational complexity, we utilize the learning-to-optimizeapproach to learn the joint design obtained from optimization techniques, whichis more amenable to practical implementations. Lastly, computer simulations arepresented to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in the twocases. Simulation results demonstrate that the RIS-assisted OFDM relayingsystem achieves sustainable achievable rate gain as compared to that withoutRIS, and that with random passive beamforming, since RIS passive beamformingcan be leveraged to recast the subcarrier matching among different subcarriersand balance the signal-to-noise ratio within each subcarrier pair.",3/8/2022,Information Theory,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This viewpointprovides a justification for the limitations of Bayesian learning when themodel is misspecified, requiring ensembling, and when data is affected byoutliers. In recent work, PAC-Bayes bounds - referred to as PAC$^m$ - werederived to introduce free energy metrics that account for the performance ofensemble predictors, obtaining enhanced performance under misspecification.This work presents a novel robust free energy criterion that combines thegeneralized logarithm score function with PAC$^m$ ensemble bounds.

Observation consistency andlocal observation consistency were identified as such conditions. To preservenormality, only observation consistency is required. Although observationconsistency preserves normality between the levels for normal specifications,we show that for specifications that are not normal, observation consistencydoes not guarantee that the supremal normal sublanguage computed on the lowlevel and on the high level coincide. Therefore, we define modified observationconsistency, under which the supremal normal sublanguages of different levelscoincide. Since we show that the verification of (modified) observationconsistency is PSPACE-hard for finite automata models and undecidable forsystems slightly more expressive than finite automata, we further discuss twostronger conditions that are easy to verify, and hence of practical interest.We apply modified observation consistency in modular systems to guarantee thatthe global supervisor can be computed locally.

This paper introduces the 3C concept, an integrativemulti-system and multi-stakeholder optimization approach for managinginfrastructure interventions (e.g., maintenance, renovation, etc.). Theproposed approach takes advantage of the benefits achieved by grouping (i.e.,optimizing) intervention activities. Intervention optimization leads tosubstantial savings on both direct intervention costs (operator) and indirectunavailability costs (society) by reducing the number of system interruptions.The proposed optimization approach is formalized into a structured mathematicalmodel that can account for the interactions between multiple infrastructurenetworks and the impact on multiple stakeholders (e.g., society andinfrastructure operators), and it can accommodate different types ofintervention, such as maintenance, removal, and upgrading. The different typesof interdependencies, within and across infrastructures, are modeled using aproposed interaction matrix (IM). The IM allows integrating the interventionsof different infrastructure networks whose interventions are normally plannedindependently. Moreover, the introduced 3C concept accounts for centralinterventions, which are those that must occur at a pre-established timemoment, where neither delay nor advance is permitted. To demonstrate theapplicability of the proposed approach, an illustrative example of amulti-system and multi-actor intervention planning is introduced. Results showa substantial reduction in the operator and societal costs.

This involvesthe use of wide-area feedback signals, which are transmitted via communicationnetworks. The performance of the closed-loop system is strongly influenced bythe delay associated with wide-area signals. The random nature of this delayintroduces a switched linear system model. The stability assessment of such asystem requires linear matrix inequality based approaches. This makes thestability analysis more complicated as the system size increases. To addressthis challenge, this paper proposes a delay-processing strategy that simplifiesthe modelling and analysis in discrete-domain. In contrast to the existingstability assessment techniques, the proposed approach is advantageous becausethe stability, as well as damping performance, can be accurately predicted by asimplified analysis.

Since lines are common in structured environments, we aim toexploit that structure to reduce the state space. The modeling of structuredenvironments proposed in this paper reduces the state space to $3N + 3$ and isalso less susceptible to singular configurations. An assumption the previousmethods make is that the camera velocity is available at all times. However,the velocity is usually retrieved from odometry, which is noisy. With this inmind, we propose coupling the camera with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)and an observer cascade.

A more general approach to transferring knowledgebetween structures, is by considering all plausible structures as points on amultidimensional base manifold and building a fibre bundle. The idea is quitepowerful, since, a mapping between points in the base manifold and theirfibres, the potential states of any arbitrary structure, can be learnt. Asmaller scale problem, but still useful, is that of learning a specific pointof every fibre, i.e. that corresponding to the undamaged state of structureswithin a population. Under the framework of PBSHM, a data-driven approach tothe aforementioned problem is developed. Structures are converted into graphsand inference is attempted within a population, using a graph neural network(GNN) algorithm. The algorithm solves a major problem existing in suchapplications. Structures comprise different sizes and are defined as abstractobjects, thus attempting to perform inference within a heterogeneous populationis not trivial. The proposed approach is tested in a simulated population oftrusses. The goal of the application is to predict the first natural frequencyof trusses of different sizes, across different environmental temperatures andhaving different bar member types. After training the GNN using part of thetotal population, it was tested on trusses that were not included in thetraining dataset. Results show that the accuracy of the regression issatisfactory even in structures with higher number of nodes and members thanthose used to train it.",3/4/2022,System and Controls,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,
160,SMANBO A Sequential MultiAgent Planning with Nominal BeliefState Optimization in Target Tracking,Tianqi Li Lucas W Krakow Swaminathan Gopalswamy,Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY),"In target tracking with mobile multi-sensor systems, sensor deploymentimpacts the observation capabilities and the resulting state estimationquality. Based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)formulation comprised of the observable sensor dynamics, unobservable targetstates, and accompanying observation laws, we present a distributedinformation-driven solution approach to the multi-agent target trackingproblem, namely, sequential multi-agent nominal belief-state optimization(SMA-NBO). SMA-NBO seeks to minimize the expected tracking error via recedinghorizon control including a heuristic expected cost-to-go (HECTG). SMA-NBOincorporates a computationally efficient approximation of the targetbelief-state over the horizon. The agent-by-agent decision-making is capable ofleveraging on-board (edge) compute for selecting (sub-optimal) target-trackingmaneuvers exhibiting non-myopic cooperative fleet behavior. The optimizationproblem explicitly incorporates semantic information defining target occlusionsfrom a world model. To illustrate the efficacy of our approach, a randomocclusion forest environment is simulated. SMA-NBO is compared to otherbaseline approaches. The simulation results show SMA-NBO 1) maintains trackingperformance and reduces the computational cost by replacing the calculation ofthe expected target trajectory with a single sample trajectory based on maximuma posteriori estimation; 2) generates cooperative fleet decision bysequentially optimizing single-agent policy with efficient usage of otheragents' policy of intent; 3) aptly incorporates the multiple weighted tracepenalty (MWTP) HECTG, which improves tracking performance with acomputationally efficient heuristic.",3/6/2022,System and Controls,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address thischallenge, we present a scalable alternative called stochastic parametricdifferentiable predictive control (SP-DPC) for unsupervised learning of neuralcontrol policies governing stochastic linear systems subject to nonlinearchance constraints. SP-DPC is formulated as a deterministic approximation tothe stochastic parametric constrained optimal control problem. This formulationallows us to directly compute the policy gradients via automaticdifferentiation of the problem's value function, evaluated over sampledparameters and uncertainties. In particular, the computed expectation of theSP-DPC problem's value function is backpropagated through the closed-loopsystem rollouts parametrized by a known nominal system dynamics model andneural control policy which allows for direct model-based policy optimization.We provide theoretical probabilistic guarantees for policies learned via theSP-DPC method on closed-loop stability and chance constraints satisfaction.Furthermore, we demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of theproposed policy optimization algorithm in three numerical examples, includingsystems with a large number of states or subject to nonlinear constraints.",3/10/2022,System and Controls,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tofacilitate robot autonomy, robust and accurate state-estimation remains a corecomponent to enable these machines for operation in a diverse set of complexenvironments. In this work, a method for multi-modal sensor fusion for robotstate-estimation and localization is presented, enabling operation ofconstruction robots in real-world scenarios. The proposed approach presents agraph-based prediction-update loop that combines the benefits of filtering andsmoothing in order to provide consistent state estimates at high update rate,while maintaining accurate global localization for large-scale earth-movingexcavators. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables a flexible integrationof asynchronous sensor measurements and provides consistent pose estimates evenduring phases of sensor dropout. For this purpose, a dual-graph design forswitching between two distinct optimization problems is proposed, directlyaddressing temporary failure and the subsequent return of global positionestimates.

To help address this data gap, we propose a network generatorfor domestic sex trafficking networks by integrating OR concepts andqualitative research. Multiple sources have been triangulated to ensure thatnetworks produced by the generator are realistic, including law enforcementcase file analysis, interviews with domain experts, and a survivor-centeredadvisory group with first-hand knowledge of sex trafficking. The output modelsthe relationships between traffickers, so-called ""bottoms"", and victims. Thisgenerator allows operations researchers to access realistic sex traffickingnetwork structures in a responsible manner that does not disclose identifiabledetails of the people involved. We demonstrate the use of output networks inexploring policy recommendations from max flow network interdiction withrestructuring. To do so, we propose a novel conceptualization of flow as theability of a trafficker to control their victims. Our results show theimportance of understanding how sex traffickers react to disruptions,especially in terms of recruiting new victims.",3/23/2022,Social and Information Networks,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such,there remains limited global scale empirical research on the topic. However,there is a large body of evidence suggesting that research collaboration isassociated with scientific productivity and performance. Further, internationalrelations theory suggests democratic nations are more likely to cooperateacross a range of modalities. This study explores country level factors thataffect dynamics of the global scientific research collaboration network,focusing on structural effects of democratic governance on the formation,persistence, and strength of international research collaboration ties. Thisstudy combines longitudinal data between 2008 and 2017 from the Varieties ofDemocracy Project, World Bank Indicators, Scopus, and Web of Sciencebibliometric data. Methods of analysis include a combination of temporal andweighted exponential random graph models to test hypotheses regarding theconnection between democratic governance and global collaboration patterns. Theresults suggest positive significant effects of both democratic governance oninternational research collaboration and assortative mixing between countrieswith similar levels of democratic governance.

The WSDM Cup 2022 seeksfor solutions that predict the existence probabilities of edges within timespans over temporal graph. This paper introduces the solution of AntGraph,which wins the 1st place in the competition. We first analysis the theoreticalupper-bound of the performance by removing temporal information, which impliesthat only structure and attribute information on the graph could achieve greatperformance. Based on this hypothesis, then we introduce several well-designedfeatures. Finally, experiments conducted on the competition datasets show thesuperiority of our proposal, which achieved AUC score of 0.666 on dataset A and0.902 on dataset B, the ablation studies also prove the efficiency of eachfeature.

167,SaPHyRa A Learning Theory Approach to Ranking Nodes in Large Networks,Phuc Thai My T Thai Tam Vu Thang N Dinh,Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),"Ranking nodes based on their centrality stands a fundamental, yet,challenging problem in large-scale networks. Approximate methods can quicklyestimate nodes' centrality and identify the most central nodes, but the rankingfor the majority of remaining nodes may be meaningless. For example, rankingfor less-known websites in search queries is known to be noisy and unstable. Tothis end, we investigate a new node ranking problem with two importantdistinctions: a) ranking quality, rather than the centrality estimationquality, as the primary objective; and b) ranking only nodes of interest, e.g.,websites that matched search criteria. We propose Sample space PartitioningHypothesis Ranking, or SaPHyRa, that transforms node ranking into a hypothesisranking in machine learning. This transformation maps nodes' centrality to theexpected risks of hypotheses, opening doors for theoretical machine learning(ML) tools. The key of SaPHyRa is to partition the sample space into exact andapproximate subspaces. The exact subspace contains samples related to the nodesof interest, increasing both estimation and ranking qualities. The approximatespace can be efficiently sampled with ML-based techniques to providetheoretical guarantees on the estimation error. Lastly, we present SaPHyRa_bc,an illustration of SaPHyRa on ranking nodes' betweenness centrality (BC). Bycombining a novel bi-component sampling, a 2-hop sample partitioning, andimproved bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, SaPHyRa_bc caneffectively rank any node subset in BC. Its performance is up to 200x fasterthan state-of-the-art methods in approximating BC, while its rank correlationto the ground truth is improved by multifold.",3/10/2022,Social and Information Networks,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiswork expands upon Ojea Quintana et al. (2021) with two main contributions fromdata science. First, based on the authors' initial network clustering andqualitative analysis techniques, we are able to clearly demarcate and visualizethe language patterns used in discourse by Antivaxxers (anti-vaccinationcampaigners and vaccine deniers) versus other clusters (collectively, Others).Second, using the characteristics of Antivaxxers' tweets, we develop textclassifiers to determine the likelihood a given user is employinganti-vaccination language, ultimately contributing to an early-warningmechanism to improve the health of our epistemic environment and bolster (andnot hinder) public health initiatives.",3/11/2022,Social and Information Networks,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model generates graphs with similar propertiesas the well-known LFR one, and its main parameter $\xi$ can be tuned to mimicits counterpart in the LFR model, the mixing parameter $\mu$.In this paper, we investigate various theoretical asymptotic properties ofthe ABCD model. In particular, we analyze the modularity function, arguably,the most important graph property of networks in the context of communitydetection. Indeed, the modularity function is often used to measure thepresence of community structure in networks. It is also used as a qualityfunction in many community detection algorithms, including the widely usedLouvain algorithm.",3/4/2022,Social and Information Networks,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While previous research hasidentified a link between political partisanship and misinformation sharingonline, the interaction between partisanship and how much misinformation peoplesee within their social networks has not been well studied. As a result, we donot know whether partisanship drives exposure to misinformation or peopleselectively share misinformation despite being exposed to factual content. Westudy Twitter discussions about the Covid-19 pandemic, classifying usersideologically along political and factual dimensions. We find partisanasymmetries in both sharing behaviors and exposure, with conservatives morelikely to see and share misinformation and moderate liberals seeing the mostfactual content. We identify multi-dimensional echo chambers that expose usersto ideologically congruent content; however, the interaction between politicaland factual dimensions creates conditions for the highly polarized users --hardline conservatives and liberals -- to amplify misinformation. Despite this,misinformation receives less attention than factual content and politicalmoderates, who represent the bulk of users in our sample, help filter outmisinformation, reducing the amount of low factuality content in theinformation ecosystem. Identifying the extent of polarization and how politicalideology can exacerbate misinformation can potentially help public healthexperts and policy makers improve their messaging to promote consensus.",3/6/2022,Social and Information Networks,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, for non-Euclidean graph data, theexisting GAN-based graph representation methods generate negative samples byrandom walk or traverse in discrete space, leading to the information loss oftopological properties (e.g. hierarchy and circularity). Moreover, due to thetopological heterogeneity (i.e., different densities across the graphstructure) of graph data, they suffer from serious topological distortionproblems. In this paper, we proposed a novel Curvature Graph GenerativeAdversarial Networks method, named \textbf{\modelname}, which is the firstGAN-based graph representation method in the Riemannian geometric manifold. Tobetter preserve the topological properties, we approximate the discretestructure as a continuous Riemannian geometric manifold and generate negativesamples efficiently from the wrapped normal distribution. To deal with thetopological heterogeneity, we leverage the Ricci curvature for local structureswith different topological properties, obtaining to low-distortionrepresentations.

172,Graph Representation Learning Beyond Node and Homophily,You Li Bei Lin Binli Luo Ning Gui,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),"Unsupervised graph representation learning aims to distill various graphinformation into a downstream task-agnostic dense vector embedding. However,existing graph representation learning approaches are designed mainly under thenode homophily assumption: connected nodes tend to have similar labels andoptimize performance on node-centric downstream tasks. Their design isapparently against the task-agnostic principle and generally suffers poorperformance in tasks, e.g., edge classification, that demands feature signalsbeyond the node-view and homophily assumption. To condense different featuresignals into the embeddings, this paper proposes PairE, a novel unsupervisedgraph embedding method using two paired nodes as the basic unit of embedding toretain the high-frequency signals between nodes to support node-related andedge-related tasks. Accordingly, a multi-self-supervised autoencoder isdesigned to fulfill two pretext tasks: one retains the high-frequency signalbetter, and another enhances the representation of commonality. Our extensiveexperiments on a diversity of benchmark datasets clearly show that PairEoutperforms the unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines, with up to 101.1\%relative improvement on the edge classification tasks that rely on both thehigh and low-frequency signals in the pair and up to 82.5\% relativeperformance gain on the node classification tasks.",3/11/2022,Social and Information Networks,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most sentiment analysis methods require emotionlabels, which can be obtained through crowdsourcing, where non-expertindividuals contribute to scientific tasks. The text itself has to be exposedto third parties in order to be labelled. In an effort to reduce the exposureof online users' information, we propose a privacy preserving text labellingmethod for varying applications, based in crowdsourcing.

In SOS programs, the variables$s(x;P)$ are polynomial in the independent variables $x$, but linear in thedecision variables $P$. Current SOS parsers, however, fail to exploit thesemi-linear structure of the polynomial variables, treating the decisionvariables as independent variables in their representation. This results inunnecessary overhead in storage and manipulation of the polynomial variables,prohibiting the parser from addressing larger-scale optimization problems. Toeliminate this computational overhead, we introduce a new representation ofpolynomial variables, the ""dpvar"" structure, that is affine in the decisionvariables. We show that the complexity of operations on variables in the dpvarrepresentation scales favorably with the number of decision variables. Wefurther show that the required memory for storing polynomial variables isrelatively small using the dpvar structure, particularly when exploiting theMATLAB sparse storage structure. Finally, we incorporate the dpvar datastructure into SOSTOOLS 4.00, and test the performance of the parser forseveral polynomial optimization problems.",3/24/2022,Mathematical Software,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,
